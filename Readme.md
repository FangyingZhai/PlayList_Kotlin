1. Click on item in the playlist and you could see the detail of an item
2. Long click on item in the playlist so that you could delete an item
3. Type in the artist name for searching
4. When you delete your text in the textview, the page will automatically go back to the main page
5. When you try to delete the item in the playlist, it will pop up an warning window to make sure that you want to delete an item
6. Message will show up when you add or delete an item in the playlist
7. In the mainpage, it could basically show up all the top tracks, not just 20 items

(10 / 10 points) The app displays the current top tracks in a GridView on startup
(10 / 10 points) The app uses a tab bar with two tabs, one for searching for tracks and one for looking at the playlist
(10 / 10 points) Data is pulled from the API and processed into a GridView on the main page. Makes use of a Fragment to display the results seamlessly.
(15 / 15 points) Selecting a track from the GridView opens a new activity with the track cover, title, and 3 other pieces of information as well as the ability to save it to the playlist.
(5 / 5 points) User can change search query by editing text field.
(10 / 10 points) User can save a track to their playlist, and the track is saved into a SQLite database.
(5 / 5 points) User can delete a track from the playlist (deleting it from the SQLite database itself).
(4 / 4 points) App is visually appealing
(1/ 1 point) Properly attribute Last.fm API as source of data.
(5 / 5 points) Code is well formatted and commented.
(10 / 10 points) All API calls are done asynchronously and do not stall the application.
(5 / 15 points) Creative portion: Be creative!
	The only thing I found that would qualify as a creative portion is the deletion of tracks from the playlist. The other items you mention above either weren't functional or were already part of the assignment.
